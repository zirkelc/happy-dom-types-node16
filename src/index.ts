import { Window } from 'happy-dom';
// The current file is a CommonJS module whose imports will produce 'require' calls; 
// however, the referenced file is an ECMAScript module and cannot be imported with 'require'.
// Consider writing a dynamic 'import("happy-dom")' call instead.
// To convert this file to an ECMAScript module, change its file extension to '.mts' or create a local package.json file with `{ "type": "module" }`.
